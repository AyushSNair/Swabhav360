🏆 Child Progress & Wellness Tracker
By SMI – Kerala Government Recognized NGO

A first-of-its-kind sports-driven mobile application built to empower children from marginalized communities by holistically tracking their development. Created by SMI, a Kerala-based NGO featured in Times of India and honored at India’s first and largest International Sports Summit, this tool is used in Red Light Areas, Government Homes, Juvenile Prisons, and the Transgender Community to build character, discipline, and dignity through sports.
